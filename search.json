These are linked by a subway that passes close to the center. Closest airport is GVA (Geneva), less than an hour from Lausanne by train. Zurich (ZRH) is a couple of hours away by train.\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlackboards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nare everywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat the center,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor us to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entrance is in the back: go around the corner on the right, enter, and climb/lift to the top.

    "text": "We aim to bring together experts and young researchers to discuss aspects of non-convex optimization that are related yet usually call for different mathematical tools: the study of landscapes, the analysis of algorithm dynamics, and the understanding of generalization in learning.\nThe schedule is kept light to favor interactions. We encourage blackboard talks where appropriate—our venue is optimized for that!\nThe event is by invitation, but feel free to sign up to our waiting list.\nThe organizers: Nicolas Boumal, Lénaïc Chizat, Nicolas Flammarion and Andrew McRae."
